Hi, my name is Mike and I&apos;m an engineer.

## About Mike

No, really.  I started
working as an electronics engineer designing semi-custom ASICs for the
F15E/F14D radar signal processor.  I designed and fielded two chips
designed for these radars then went on to start working an even larger
design for what turned out to be the F22 signal processor.  For that I
designed a 16 bit purpose built processor using logic gates, specified
the instruction set and led the team to implement the microcode.  Then
built an assembler and coded with that to get the behaviors I needed.

Over the years, I migrated up the layers into more of a software role and
have been involved in all types of developments, from defense industry
to financial industry applications.  I created a complex event processor
to derive interesting information directly from financial data streams.
I defined the initial architecture for an open source implementation of
the OMG DDS specification.

These days, I am attempting to create useful applications of data science
using cloud based tools.  This involves an entire suite of open source
tools &mdash; including the hadoop ecosystem &mdash; to provide a data
to user interface application, including analytics.  Both descriptive
statistical models to describe data as well as machine learning
algorithms to characterize the data and make predictions about what
happens next.

This blog contains my technical notes.  I use this to hold details about
how to do useful things for various different topics.  If the contents
are useful for anyone else, so much for the better.

In addition to straight technical techniques and code, I include
information about topics and subjects that are of interest to me and
possibly to others.  I provide some reviews of courses, books, and
meetings that may be of interest as well.

## About Brillouin Zones

LÃ©on Brillouin was a founder of modern solid state physics and
&apos;discovered&apos; the zones in that field.

These zones are cells in reciprocal space (also known as
<strong>k</strong> space).  The first zone is uniquely defined primitive
cell in the space.  The boundaries of the cell are given by planes
defined by points on the reciprocal lattice.  The zones are useful in
crystallography and how it applies to semiconductor physics.

Cool, eh.

I&apos;ve always been fascinated by the concept of reciprocal
space.  While the Brillouin zone is defined in a lattice reciprocal space,
the simplest reciprocal space is on the number line:  take the
reciprocal of every number on the line and you will create the space.  It
is very useful for finding roots (zero crossings) of functions, since the
interval from between -1 and 1 in reciprocal space includes all locations
on the line everywhere (except for between -1 and 1, of course).

In essence, this means that the entire infinite set of numbers is held in
that small interval between -1 and 1 in reciprocal space.

The whole contained within the part.

## About Brillozon

Brillozon is a D&amp;D character I played a few years ago.  A simple bard
not harming anyone, killed mercilessly by a ruthless DM.  I liked him while
he lasted: all 6 levels.  I can&apos;t feel to bad about it
since <strike>almost</strike> all adventures with that DM ended in total
party wipes.
