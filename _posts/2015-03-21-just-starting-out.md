So.  It's come to this.  I'm not entirely sure if this is supposed to be
HTML or markdown as I edit the file.  I guess I will find out.  Mebbe.

Aaaannnndddd... markdown it is.  Very nice.

Just to have something here, a list of stuff:

* front wall
* bookshelf
* lamp
* french doors
* desk
* Aeron chair
* globe
