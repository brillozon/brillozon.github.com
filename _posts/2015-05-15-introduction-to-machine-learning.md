This post includes some resources about machine learning that may be
useful.

In 2014, I put together a lunch presentation to introduce the topic
of machine learning.  It covers a lot of ground and uses images from
courese materials and that I found out on the web as quick examples for
the discussion.

After the lunch talk, I extended the material with verbiage to support
the images and created my own imagery.  This became a standalone article
that was published as part of the <a href="http://www.ociweb.com">Object
Computing, Inc.</a> Software Engineering Technology Trends (SETT) series.

At the bottom of the article is an embedded Shiny application that allows
you to explore some of the  basic results from a simple categorization
exercise.
